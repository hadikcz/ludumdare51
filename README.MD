# About game:
Your friend gave you a special hen that can lay an egg every 10 seconds. If you can take advantage of this, keep the hen alive and breed her, you'll become rich.

You won't have it easy, though, the hen is very hungry and thirsty, and it's not cheap to feed. Also, if your hens get too many, they can eat all your food and kill all your hens.
